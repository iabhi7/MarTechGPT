# Model Card: Subject Line Optimizer

## Model Details

- **Model Name**: Email Subject Line Optimizer
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Type**: Fine-tuned language model with engagement prediction
- **Base Model**: Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2
- **Training Date**: June 2023
- **License**: MIT License

## Model Description

The Subject Line Optimizer combines a large language model (LLM) for creative text generation with a predictive model that estimates engagement metrics like open rate and click-through rate. It analyzes historical campaign performance to learn patterns associated with successful subject lines.

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Open Rate RMSE | 0.046 | Root mean squared error of predicted vs. actual open rates |
| Click Rate RMSE | 0.031 | Root mean squared error of predicted vs. actual click rates |
| Quality Score | 8.3/10 | Human evaluator ratings of subject line quality |
| Diversity Score | 7.8/10 | Measured uniqueness among generated alternatives |

## Limitations

- Performs best for B2C marketing emails in English
- May generate subject lines with unexpected emotional tone
- Predictions are less accurate for highly niche industries with limited training data
- Performance varies by industry, with e-commerce showing stronger results than B2B software

## Ethical Considerations

- **Privacy**: Trained only on anonymized, aggregated campaign data
- **Bias**: May reflect biases present in historical marketing data; regular auditing recommended
- **Transparency**: Model should be presented as an AI assistant, not replacing human judgment
- **Evaluation**: Regular monitoring of generated content recommended

## Training Data

The model was trained on:
- 50,000+ historical email campaigns
- Open rates, click rates, and conversion data
- Industry and target audience metadata
- Subject line features (length, sentiment, urgency signals)

All training data was anonymized and contains no personally identifiable information.
